hi this is myo myo khant
how are you

I am fine and you?
I am good thank you.
a file handle open for rad can be treated as  a sequence of strings where each line in the file is a string in the sequence.
we  can use the for statement to iterate through a sequence
remember-a sequence is an ordered set
so that just says treat a file handle as a sequence of lines.
